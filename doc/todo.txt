To-do list
----------

- Docstrings everywhere
- Add __all__ to __init__.py
- Add names to the standard rounding modes so that their representations are
  pleasanter. (Currently looks like 'standard_rounding_mode.<locals>.round_decide.)
- Formatting:
  - Make precision optional
  - Alignment and field width
  - Support for 'e', 'g', '%', 'n'
  - Support for thousands separators
  - Find a way to resolve ambiguity between the two uses of z (for round-ties-to-zero
    and for negative sign suppression). We also need to resolve
    ambiguity between 'e' for "even" and 'e' for the type.
    Suggest prefix of "r" for specifying rounding mode.
  - Support for form of scientific notation with zero digits before the point:
    3.1415 -> .3142e-1
  - Make number of digits and the presence of a + sign in the exponent adjustable.
